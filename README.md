#### Python-LinkedList
A linked list in Python is a type of linear data structure that is similar to arrays. It is a collection of nodes that are linked with each other. Linked lists are an ordered collection of objects. They differ from lists in the way that they store elements in memory. While lists use a contiguous memory block to store references to their data, linked lists store references as part of their own elements. Linkedlist can be used to implement queues or stacks as well as graphs. Each node contains two things: The data and a link that connects it to another node.

The first node is called the head, and itâ€™s used as the starting point for any iteration through the list. The last node must have its next reference pointing to None to determine the end of the list. Each element of a linked list is called a node and every node has two different fields:
- Data that contains the value to be stored in the node.
- Next that contains a reference to the next node on the list.

Linkedlist are mainly of three types Singly Linkedlist, Doubly Linkedlist and Circular Linkedlist. I have implemented Singly and Doubly Linkedlist in the following repository
